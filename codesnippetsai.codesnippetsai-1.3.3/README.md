## Code Snippets AI - Turn Your Questions Into Code with GPT-4!

This Visual Studio Code extension allows you to use [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) (on the Pro Plan) or ChatGPT to generate code or natural language responses to your questions.

Automatically generate code from scratch, ask questions, get explanations, refactor code, find bugs and more!

> Please ensure you are on the most recent version (v1.3.2) for faster and more accurate responses!

### Built with GPT-4 & ChatGPT

We use GPT-4 & ChatGPT, which provides faster and more accurate responses to your questions, compared to GPT-3 or Codex.

### Installation

To use this extension, install it from the VSCode marketplace.

#### Get your API key

To use this extension, you will need an API key from your [dashboard](https://codesnippets.ai/).

To get one, follow these steps:

1. Go to [codesnippets.ai](https://codesnippets.ai/)
2. If you don't have an account, you will need to create one or sign up.
3. Sign up to the 7 day free trial.
4. Copy the API key from the dashboard and paste it into the Access Token field in the extension settings.
5. After completing these steps, the extension should be ready to use.

#### Why not use an OpenAI API key?

After asking the development community, we have found a few key points that influenced our decision to introduce a pricing model:

- ChatGPT Plus is expensive at $24/month.
- Using GPT-4 can lead to more expensive monthly cost for users, over $30/month!
- CodeSnippets.ai is only $10/month and uses the same GPT-4 API on our PRO plan, or ChatGPT with other Plans.
- You can also save your code snippets into your online library for your whole team to access!
- Fetch your code snippets from your online library

### Usage

1. Open a file in Visual Studio Code and click on the CodeSnippets icon in the sidebar.
   - This will open a panel with an input field.
2. Enter your prompt or question.
3. Click Enter.
   - The prompt will be sent to the AI.
   - The response will be displayed below the input field in the sidebar.

#### Add context to request with code selection

Select some code in the editor, right click on it and choose one of the following commands from the context menu:

- AI -> Ask anything : Opens the custom command window for you to insert your own prompt. (You can also press Ctrl + Shift + A). With or without selected code for added prompt context.
- AI -> Add tests : Creates tests for the selected code.
- AI -> Find bugs : Looks for problems/errors in the selected code, fixes and explains them.
- AI -> Optimize : Make the selected code more concise and easier to read.
- AI -> Explain : Explains what the selected code does.
- AI -> Add comments : Generate comments for the selected code.
- AI -> Refactor code: Refactors the selected code.
- AI -> Documentation : Creates detailed documentation for the selected code.
- Save Code Snippet : Saves your code snippet to your online library for your whole team to access.

#### Insert code from CodeSnippets.ai

To insert code from the AI response into the editor, click on the Insert button on the code block. The code will be automatically inserted where your cursor is currently placed in the editor.
